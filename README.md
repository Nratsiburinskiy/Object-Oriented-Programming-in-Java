# [UC San Diego/Coursera: Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/home/welcome)

I'm making commits on branches named after their respective modules; **I'm not merging the branches to master**, which means if you want to see the work progress for a specific module, you'll need to checkout that branch. 

 

original README follows: 
```
unfolding_app_template and UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code
==================================================================

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!
